JANUARY:
- worked on plan

FEBRUARY:
- worked on plan
- read papers
- literature survey
- build data set

MARCH:
- build data set
- defined measure for signal (LOC on age.months)
- study wavelet analysis
- first complete wavelet analysis run on data set

APRIL:
- build data set of higher quality (coverage, minimal months)
- second complete wavelet analysis run on data set
- validation of found sequences
- dead project identification
- dead project verification
- ran similar sequences using dead projects
- ran scripts on LOCchurn, no patterns as result
- ran scripts on activedevs, no substantial patterns as result
- RESULTS: sequences all indicate a stagnation in LOC change

MAY:
- survival analysis on LOC
- pattern identification and typing
- RESULTS: patterns indicate stagnation in LOC change, still active
- RESULTS: 25 patterns of type A in both dead and alive projects
- RESULTS: survival analysis of groups with and without pattern of type A revealed with pattern dies earlier,
           but no median survival can be calculated as less than 50% of the group dies.


Steps:
- Data selection
  - OhlohAnalytics: data gathering, validation, cleansing
  - Data analysis: subsequent data series, minimal length
  - Data selection and representativeness (Nagappan, Microsoft Research)
  - RESULT: 99.5% representative set of 250 projects' evolution data

- Wavelet transform
  - Signal selection
  - Discrete wavelet transformation
  - RESULT: 22,943 data points in LOC of 250 projects transformed in 7 levels of decomposition using two types of coefficients

- Wavelet analysis: similar sequence detection
  - Compare coefficients from two projects to find similarities
  - RESULT: 1,669,448 similar sequences found; only 16 of shift coefficients, the rest scale coefficients. 

- Wavelet analysis: pattern detection
  - Aggregation of similar sequences to groups of sequences forming a pattern
  - RESULT: 16,049 patterns found. All of scale coefficients.

- Pattern analysis
  - Dead project identification (21 dead projects found)
  - Patterns in dead projects (967 patterns)
  - Patterns at end of evolution of dead projects (type A: 25 patterns)
  - Projects having type A patterns die earlier: survival analysis
  - RESULT: There is something with these patterns.

- Conclusions
