LEAST OCCURING
The least occuring sequences all occured multiple times in a single project:
   1: Project 31794, sequence of length 13, max.dev. 0.00381, no LOC change between point 2 and 14 (of 38) at revlevel 6.
   2: Project 325178, sequence of length 10, max.dev. 0.00461, no LOC change between point 39 and 49 (of 55) at revlevel 6.
   3: Project 408980, sequence of length 4, max.dev. 0.00425, no LOC change between point 21 and 24 (of 24) at revlevel 5.

MOST OCCURING
The most occuring two sequences both occured 1,424 times in 204 projects, length 4, max.dev. 0.00499 (the maximum allowed
deviation = 0.005) and the sequences indicate a short period of no LOC change (with respect to the max.dev.).

LONGEST
The three longest sequences have length 19, occured 4-5 times in 4-5 projects.
  1. Seq.id 361 occured 4 times in 4 projects. However, it is hard to tell how the base project is related to the other 3.
     The other 3 are obviously related to each other; no LOC change.
  2. Seq.id 6398 occured 5 times in 5 projects. All projects have had no LOC change in the region of the sequence.
  3. Seq.id 7100 occured 4 times in 4 projects. All projects have had no LOC change in the region of the sequence.

FEEDBACK
- The sequences indicate there was no LOC change (with the max. deviation as allowed margins), however, the sequences
  are longer in reality (and in the project files) than the region detection has identified. This may be
  an issue with the detection script, a constraint, or something else that should be adjusted. I might be able to extract all
  sequences that overlap and compute the length of the total sequence.
- All these sequences have the same cause: no LOC change (with respect to max.deviation). However, they were not identified
  as similar, but as individual instances. The similarity occurs when it is at the same revlevel and of same length.
- Not a single sequence was detected using shift coefficients. Why is that?
