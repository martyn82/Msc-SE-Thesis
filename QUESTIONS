Q: How many data points per project (% of total evolution data of a project) is needed at a minimum for solid analysis?
A: A non-interrupted sequence with a certain minimum of data points is needed. Missing information might be identified as a pattern which is not.

Q: What is the minimum sequence length?
A: ?

Q: What does LOC.Churn per Active.Developers say?
A: Plain LOC.Churn per Active.Developers is flawed because:
(1) It does not say anything about team size; teams could have members that haven't committed in that month; and,
(2) It does not say anything about team performance; team size varies during project lifetime, all churns are aggregated per team size, thus the longer a project stays in the same team size, the better the project will seem to perform with that team size.

Q: Is Active.Developers per 1k LOC.Churn better? This says something about team performance?
A: ?

Q: We could try to determine the code churn per contributor metric (Crowston et al. 2003) by dividing the LOC.Churn by Active.Developers. Is it accurate enough?
A: ?
   If there is 10,000 LOC churn and 10 active developers, then it is flattened to 100 LOC per developer.
   The real division could be 2,000 per developer for 4 developers, 1,000 for 1, and 200 for the others.
   Depends on what relation is analyzed.
