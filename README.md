### Automatic Means of Detecting Warning Signs in Software Evolution

The repository of my Master's thesis.
I will replicate a research by Siim Karus: "Automatic Means of Identifying Evolutionary Events in Software Development".

In this study, I will use a data set of open-source software (OSS) projects. These projects are tracked by
[Ohloh.net](http://www.ohloh.net).

To gather facts about the projects and validating the projects to analyze, I use the tool [OhlohAnalytics](https://github.com/martyn82/OhlohAnalytics)
by Magiel Bruntink.
