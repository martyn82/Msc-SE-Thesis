\chapter{Research method}
\label{method}

This section describes the methods used to answer the research questions. A
good structure of this section often follows the sub questions by providing a
method for each.
The research method can be based on the “Scientific method”, but more creative
solutions could be defined as well. In any case, the method needs a thorough
motivation grounded in theory in order to be acceptable.
As part of the method a number of hypotheses are described. These hypotheses
will be tested by the research, using the methods described here.
An important part of this section is validation. How will you evaluate and
validate the outcomes of the research? You can look at Paul Klint’s homepage
for examples of this section as
well\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/RichardKettelerij.pdf}.
