\section{Research approach}
The research will be conducted in the following steps:
\begin{description}
	\item[Literature study.] As part of the research plan, relevant literature will
	be studied in order to get familiar with the topics touched by this
	study. Important topics are, the ecosystem of OSS organisation and community,
	and the success and survival factors of OSS projects. Literature regarding
	wavelets, wavelet transforms and analysis, and in particular the Haar wavelet
	will be studied to understand its workings. The results of this study are
	provided as background material in chapter \ref{background}.
	
	\item[Data selection.] In the next step, the OSS projects for the study will be
	selected. The evolution data of these OSS projects will be validated and
	cleansed to ensure all data for these projects is consistent.
	
	Further evaluation of the data should be done prior to the selection of the
	data set for the study. It is expected that not all data is suitable for
	analysis.
	
	An important criterion for the data is that the evolution data for each project
	is continuous, in the sense that it does not contain 'gaps'. Analysis on time
	series requires subsequent series of data.
	
	The data set for analysis should also be representative to the total set of
	OSS projects in order to be able to generalise conclusions from the
	projects within the data set to the world of OSS projects in general.
	
	\item[Wavelet analysis.] This step is divided into two sub-steps: wavelet
	transform, and wavelet analysis.
	
	First, the evolution data of the selected projects will be transformed using
	discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The results of these transforms are kept for
	further analysis. Important here is the choice of signal. The signal is a model
	of a time variable and a frequency variable, and is also known as a 'wave'. The
	signal can be composed of any measurable property of a project's evolution, such as
	'lines of code' (LOC).
	
	Second, the results of the transforms are being analysed to find patterns. A
	pattern is a sequence of transformed data that occurs multiple times. To be
	able to find patterns, we need to define in detail when a sequence is a
	pattern. Choosing what recurrent in terms of number of occurrances will highly
	influence the number of patterns found and possibly influence the types
	of patterns we are able to detect. The same counts for the allowed error or
	deviation in similarity for patterns.
	
	\item[Pattern identification.] The patterns found in the Wavelet analysis step
	will be further analysed to find patterns that are 'warning signs'. This is a
	pattern that leads to the 'end of code evolution' for a project (recall
	\ref{itm:question_warningsigns}). The validation needed in this step is
	described in section \ref{method:validation}.
	
	\item[Conclude.] The final phase in the study is the analysis of the results to
	come to conlusions and answers to the research questions (section
	\ref{questions}).

\section{Validation}
\label{method:validation}
\subsection{Dead projects}
\label{def:dead}
A project is considered 'dead' if it complies to the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the project showed no change in 'lines of code' (LOC) for the last 12
	months;
	\item the project has had 0 contributors in code for the last 12 months;
	\item the project has had 0 LOC churn\footnote{LOC churn: the sum of LOC added
	and LOC deleted.} for the last 12 months.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The above properties combined specify that the project has had no code activity
for the past year, meaning the code evolution of the project has stopped.
According to this definition, changes in documentation, wiki pages, external
library updates, and other non-code changes are still allowed for dead
projects.

To compare dead and alive projects from the data set, we can use the above
definition to identify the projects from the data set that are dead. The
projects that are not 'dead' by this definition are considered to be 'alive'.

\subsection{Dead project validation}
To be sure that the projects from our data set that comply to the definition of
dead (section \ref{def:dead}) are indeed dead, manual validation of these
findings have to be done.
In verifying if a project is dead, we will manually consult the project's
website, its source code repository, and possibly other sources to verify the
properties of a 'dead' project.

- The plan
- Methodology / method per question
- Hypotheses
- Validation

This section describes the methods used to answer the research questions. A
good structure of this section often follows the sub questions by providing a
method for each.

The research method can be based on the “Scientific method”, but more creative
solutions could be defined as well. In any case, the method needs a thorough
motivation grounded in theory in order to be acceptable.

As part of the method a number of hypotheses are described. These hypotheses
will be tested by the research, using the methods described here.

An important part of this section is validation. How will you evaluate and
validate the outcomes of the research? You can look at Paul Klint’s homepage
for examples of this section as
well\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/RichardKettelerij.pdf}.
