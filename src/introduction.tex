\section{Problem analysis}

In closed source projects, many evolutionary events are dictated by the
management. Events such as team size changes, changes in activity and progress
are often the result of a change in, for instance, the hiring policy of the
organization, or an approaching deadline. These events can be used to identify
project scale and progress, which allows comparing and co-analyzing different
projects.\\

In an open-source software (OSS) project, evolutionary events are mostly
theoretical with little empirical validation. Changes in team size, activity,
and the like are more organic. This means that different OSS projects cannot be
compared on the same scale.\\

OSS projects are being used by many organizations in an industrial environment.
This makes evaluating the survivability of OSS projects important.
At \hostOrg, developers extensively use OSS projects in their day-to-day
work. The projects vary from developers tools, and utilities, to operating
systems and full system stacks. These OSS projects include, but are not limited
to, Ansible, Apache web server, MySQL database, and Ubuntu/Linux. Amongst the
previously listed well-known projects, less known projects are used.

\paragraph{}
Automatically detecting warning signs in the evolution of OSS projects is useful
if the people at the company uses OSS projects to support the business. This
business can be anything that is valuable to a company. The method of
automatically detecting warning signs can aid in selecting OSS projects for new
purposes. For instance, selecting a healthy project that has a bigger chance of
surviving is more suitable because it is able to support the business for a
longer period than a project of which the activity is decreasing. Additionally,
the method can be used to monitor projects that the people at the company are
using. In case serious anomalies are detected, a decision can be made to look
for alternatives and eventually replace projects that have a lower chance of
survival.

\paragraph{}
This study is a replication and extension of the research by Siim Karus
\emph{Automatic Means of Identifying Evolutionary Events in Software
Development} \cite{karus2013}. It is extended by using a larger data set and
attempts to find warning signs in the software evolution of OSS projects.

\section{Research questions}
\label{questions}

The main research question of the thesis is (RQ1):
\begin{description}
	\item \hfill \\ \emph{\researchQuestion}
\end{description}

\paragraph{}
Wavelet analysis is the analysis of waveforms. It is an analysis tool that
started in seismology. Its use is expanded to many other fields, such as,
economics, geographics, audio and video processing, and others, to perform
all kinds of digital signal processing (DSP).

Software evolution comprises various measures, such as lines of code, number of
developers, etc. These metrics can be put in the frequency domain of a waveform,
whereas the age in months of a project can be put in the time domain of a
waveform. This way, wavelet analysis can be used to analyze software evolution.

As wavelet analysis is a tool that is relatively easy to automate, it
provides automatic detection of patterns in software evolution.

\paragraph{}
In order to find the answer to the main question, the following questions will
be answered:
\begin{description}
	\item \hfill \\ \emph{\subQuestionOne} (RQ2)
	\item \hfill \\ \emph{\subQuestionTwo} (RQ3)
\end{description}

\section{Outline}

Chapter \ref{background} will provide more information on prior research in the
field of OSS survivability. In chapter \ref{method} the method and approach of
the research is discussed. Next, in chapter \ref{research}, the research
execution itself is described. Chapter \ref{results} presents the results of
the research. Chapter \ref{analysis} discusses the results after analysis and
presents the conclusions of the research.

INTRODUCTION

An introduction and overview of your thesis. Be sure to structure your thesis
such that you do not have to repeat yourself later. In this section you do not
cover details, but you give the reader an idea of the context, a brief overview
of the research, and how the remainder of the thesis is structured.

MOTIVATION

This section describes in detail what problem the research is addressing, and
what the motivation is to address this problem.

There is a concise and objective statement of the research questions (or
hypotheses you are testing) and goals. It is made clear why these questions and
goals are important and relevant to the outside world (i.e., the field of
research or industry that you are addressing). You can already split the main
research question into sub questions in this chapter.

This section also describes an analysis of the problem: where does it occur and
how, how often, and what are the consequences?

An important part is also to scope to research: what aspects are included and
what aspects are deliberately left out, and why? An example introduction can be
found on Paul Klintâ€™s
homepage\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/ReinierLabee.pdf}.
