\chapter{Introduction}
An introduction and overview of your thesis. Be sure to structure your thesis
such that you do not have to repeat yourself later. In this section you do not
cover details, but you give the reader an idea of the context, a brief overview
of the research, and how the remainder of the thesis is structured.
