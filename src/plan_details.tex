\section{Expected results}
At the end of the project, I expect to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If wavelet analysis can be used to find objective warning signs leading
	to end of code evolution (RQ, replicated results from Karus or refutation).
	\item Which patterns or events are likely to be a warning sign.
	\item Which patterns or events are a warning sign for end of code evolution.
	\item How early we can tell that an OSS project is dying.
\end{itemize}

\section{Required expertise}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Expertise on discrete wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item R Statistics programming language.
	\item R Statistics Suite operation.
	\item Mining source code repositories.
	\item Code metrics and what it actually measures.
	\item Software evolution in terms of active, inactive, dead, size, etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improper understanding of wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item Improper understanding of the metrics.
	\item Improper understanding of the software evolution data.
	\item Insufficient time to gather and analyse all data.
	\item Insufficient data to construct a data set that is representative to the
	real-world distribution of OSS projects in terms of scale, progress, and
	activity.
	\item Gap between the method of the original paper and my understanding of the
	paper is too large (e.g., missing pieces, unable to contact Karus).
\end{itemize}
