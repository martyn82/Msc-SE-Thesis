\subsection{Research method}
\paragraph{}
The research question is based on a theory how the chosen analysis method could
solve the question. A confirmatory case study will be done by choosing a
representative data set of open source software projects and analyse these by
using wavelet transforms to find evolutionary events.

The theory is based on the observations on analysis on time series in
economical and social studies. Which have been successfully done using wavelet
analysis. In the evolution of software projects we are also looking at time
series. Therefore, wavelet analysis seems a logical method to analyse software
project evolution.

\subsection{Expected results}
At the end of the research, we expect to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If wavelet analysis can be used to find objective warning signs leading
	to end of code evolution (replicated results by Karus or refutation).
	\item Early detection of anomalies to take action before an anomaly becomes a
	long-term issue that might lead to the end of (part of) the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Required expertise}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Expertise on discrete wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item Mining source code repositories.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improper understanding of wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item Insufficient data to construct a data set that is representative to the
	real-world distribution of OSS projects in terms of scale, progress, and
	activity.
\end{itemize}
