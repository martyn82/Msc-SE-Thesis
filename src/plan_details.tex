\section{Expected results}
At the end of the project, I expect to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If wavelet analysis can be used to find objective warning signs leading
	to end of code evolution (replicated results by Karus or refutation).
	\item Early detection of anomalies to take action before an anomaly becomes a
	long-term issue that might lead to the end of (part of) the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Required expertise}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Expertise on discrete wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item R statistics programming language.
	\item R statistics suite operation.
	\item Mining source code repositories.
	\item Code metrics.
	\item Code evolution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improper understanding of wavelet transformation and analysis.
	\item Insufficient data to construct a data set that is representative to the
	real-world distribution of OSS projects in terms of scale, progress, and
	activity.
\end{itemize}
