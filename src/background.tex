The survivability of OSS projects has been of interest by many researchers. In
an industrial environment, a project is considered successful if it is completed
within time and budget constraints. In OSS projects, these constraints do not
always exist. The indicators of success for OSS projects differ from the one
study to the other.

\paragraph{}
In a study by Samoladas et al. a method for survival analysis on OSS projects
was proposed. These methods were employed to predict the survivability of the
projects by examining their duration, combined with other characterstics such
as application domain and number of committers. Although these metrics give
insight in the survivability chances of a project, it was also found that
adding a developer to the team of contributors increased the survivability of
the project substantially. The authors of the paper proposed two main research
issues to be addressed in the future. The first one is to add more projects to
the study with possibly a different categorization. In addition, the effects of
more project parameters, such as programming language should be examined. This
is not trivial since typically more than one language is used in each project
\cite{samoladas2010}.

\paragraph{}
A study by Raja and Tretter on defining a measure of OSS project survivability.
They have been looking for vitality of OSS projects: the ability of a project
to grow and maintain its structure in the presence of perturbations. They
identified three dimensions of project viability: vigor -- the ability of a
project to grow --, resilience -- the ability of a project to recover from
disturbances --, and organization -- the structure exhibited in the project.
These dimensions represent three distinct characteristics of project viability
\cite{raja2012}. Although this study is of use to determine survivability of a
project it is a snapshot of a point in time, whereas the analysis of time
series may provide a more objective judgement of project survivability.

\paragraph{}
Crowston et al. identified measures that can be applied to assess the success of
OSS projects. The authors used the DeLone and McLean model of information
systems success to evaluate OSS project success. The aspects identified by
DeLone and McLean are elaborated; output of systems development -- it is
believed that a project that has a high frequency of releases is healthy --,
process of systems development -- the number of developers, the individual
level of activity, and cycle time (time between releases) --, and
project effects -- employment opportunities of the contributors, individual
reputation, and knowledge creation. It was found that many of these aspects are
indicators of OSS project success \cite{crowston2003}.

\paragraph{}
Another study conducted by Crowston et al. extended the previous study by using
Free/Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS) projects. They found that the number of
developers as a simple count of developers is a somewhat flawed number as
it aggregates the number of developers leaving and the number of developers
joining a project. A 'churn' of the developers or a 'tenure' of individuals
would be more appropriate.
Furthermore, this study took projects from one source code repository,
SourceForge, instead of different repositories \cite{crowston2006}.

\paragraph{}
A study conducted by Wang has shown that early warning signs can be found in
six crucial factors of OSS projects success: developer participation effort,
developer service quality, software license restrictiveness, targeted users,
community social network ties, and community quality of social ties
\cite{wang2012}.
However, warning signs in these factors are not easily detected automatically.

\paragraph{}
Taking into account the measures and metrics used in above studies, combined
with the measures and metrics used by the author of the original research paper,
we can see what data is needed to replicate the research by Karus
\cite{karus2013}.

This chapter contains all the information needed to put the thesis into
context. It is common to use (a revised version) of your literature survey for
this purpose.
It is important to refer from your text to sources you have used, as listed in
your bibliography section (appendix). For example, “XP is a recent agile
development method [1]” is a common style of doing this, where the following
entry would be included in your bibliography:
[1] K. Beck, E. Gamma, Test infected: Programmers love writing tests, Java
Report 3 (7) (1998) 51–56.
If you want to refer to books you have read as part of the curriculum, you can
also do so in this way.
Have a look at Chapter 2 of this example thesis at Paul’s
homepage\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/RichardKettelerij.pdf}.
