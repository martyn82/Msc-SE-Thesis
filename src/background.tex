\chapter{Background}
This chapter contains all the information needed to put the thesis into
context. It is common to use (a revised version) of your literature survey for
this purpose.
It is important to refer from your text to sources you have used, as listed in
your bibliography section (appendix). For example, “XP is a recent agile
development method [1]” is a common style of doing this, where the following
entry would be included in your bibliography:
[1] K. Beck, E. Gamma, Test infected: Programmers love writing tests, Java
Report 3 (7) (1998) 51–56.
If you want to refer to books you have read as part of the curriculum, you can
also do so in this way.
