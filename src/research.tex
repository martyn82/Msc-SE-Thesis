\chapter{Research}
This chapter reports on the execution of the research method as described in Chapter 3.

If the research has been divided into phases (e.g., using sub questions) the
phases are introduced, reported on and concluded individually. If needed this
Chapter could be split up to balance out the sizes of all Chapters.
An example Research Chapter is provided as Chapter 3 at Paulâ€™s home
page\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/ReneWiegers.pdf}.
