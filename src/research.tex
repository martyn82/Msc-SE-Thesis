This chapter describes the execution of the research.

\section{Data set}
The data set of 250 projects was selected using the method described in section
\ref{method:data}. It was conducted in the steps described in the following
paragraphs.

\subsection{Initial analysis, validation, and cleansing}
The evolution data of a project is available as monthly data from Ohloh.net. The
raw data of 12,360 projects was collected from Ohloh.net in July 2013 by Magiel
Bruntink as part of his research \cite{bruntink2014}. It was then analysed,
validated, and cleansed accordingly by Bruntink's tool \emph{OhlohAnalytics}\rm
\cite{ohlohanalytics}.

This step consists of the analysis, validation, and cleansing of the data by
detecting inconsistent values and removing these records from the data set.
Additional fields are derived from and added to the raw data for convenience.

The complete list of data fields are shown in table \ref{table:fields}. The
column 'Source' specifies if the field is either 'Raw' data (i.e., directly
available from Ohloh), or if it is added by the OhlohAnalytics tool as derived
from an operation on one or more other fields. In the latter case, the fields
are listed. The 'lines of code' (LOC) metric is equal to the LOC metric used by
Ohloh. This is the total number of source lines of code at the given time of
analysis. These lines include all lines of source text for the project in any
programming language, but excludes blank lines and comments.

The result of this step is a consistent data set of evolution data of 10,811
projects.

\subsection{Continuous data sequence}
The evolution data of the 10,811 projects contained gaps. Many projects do not
have a continuous series of evolution data. We expect a continuous series of
data to be required in order to analyse time series for a project. Therefore, a
number representing the continuity of the data was needed. For each project the
difference between the minimum and maximum values of the $age\_in\_months$ fact
is taken, added by one, giving us the expected number of data points a project
should have. The calculation of the fraction of total evolution data is done
for each project.

After the fractions of the total evolution data for each project are caculated,
we can filter these projects and keep only the projects that have all data points
between minimum and maximum $age\_in\_months$. From the set of 10,811 projects,
a total number of 6,418 projects is left.

\subsection{Minimal sequence length}
As a final step in validating and cleaning the master data set, we will be
keeping only the projects that have at least 12 data points (i.e., have a
subsequent evolution period of at least 1 year).

After this selection, a set of 5,986 projects is left.

\subsection{Sample selection}
For the selection of a sample of 250 projects, we use the tool created by
Nagappan \emph{et al. }\rm\cite{nagappan}. This tool takes a sample set and
selects additional projects to add to the sample that increase the overall
representativeness of that sample.

The tool iteratively selects 250 projects and adds it to the sample. Each
additional project is selected by its score to maximally increase the
representativeness of the sample as a whole, compared to the master data.

The master data is a list of 20,028 projects tracked by Ohloh.net delivered with
this tool. A pre-filtering of this master data was done to make the tool select
only the projects that appear in our data set of 5,986 projects. After
pre-filtering, a subset of the master data of 1,588 projects is left. From this
subset, a sample of 250 projects was selected.

The resulting sample of 250 projects was scored against the initial master data
of 20,028 projects and scores a 99.5\% representativeness.

\paragraph{}
The evolution data of 250 distinct projects make a total of 22,943 data points.
The biggest project having 321 data points, the smallest having 14 data points.

\section{Analysis}

The 250 projects are analysed by selecting time series (signals) of their
evolution data. In this research, analysis is done on modeling $age\_in\_months$
on the time domain, and $loc\_fact$ on the frequency domain. The signals per
project represent the value of the 'lines of code' at a given 'age in months'.

\subsection{Wavelet transform and analysis}

\subsubsection{Wavelet transform}
Each project's signal is separately transformed using discrete wavelet
transform. The results of the transforms are saved per project. This is the raw
data after decomposing signals and is saved for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Similar sequence identification}
The similar sequence identification found 1,669,448 sequences that occurred
at least 2 times in the data. Only 16 sequences were found using wavelet
coefficients, the other 1,669,432 sequences were found using filter
coefficients. This is expected as filter coefficients are better than wavelet
coefficients at finding small changes in signals.

\subsubsection{Similar sequence grouping}
The last step in the analysis of the found sequences aggregates and groups the
sequences together and keeps only the 'popular' sequences. As mentioned, a
sequence is considered popular if it appears at least 3 times in the data.

The results of this step revealed a total of 16,049 of such popular sequences.
All the popular sequences were found in the sequences by filter coefficients,
and none in the sequences by wavelet coefficients. The sequences occurred at
least 4 times, and at most 1,511 times. They occur in at least 1 and at most 204
projects. Their lengths differ between 4 points and 19 points across various
decomposition levels (levels of detail).

If the research has been divided into phases (e.g., using sub questions) the
phases are introduced, reported on and concluded individually. If needed this
Chapter could be split up to balance out the sizes of all Chapters.
