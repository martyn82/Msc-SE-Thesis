\section{Dead project validation}
\label{section:deads}
Of the 250 projects used for this study, a total of 43 projects complied to the
definition of a dead project as defined in section \ref{def:dead}. The data set
contains data points up to June 2013, because the data was gathered in July
2013. Manual evaluation of the 43 potential dead projects, with data up to April
2014, revealed that 21 (8.4\%) were actually dead.
For each of the 43 projects, the project's website, source code repository, and
commit history was consulted. The results of the evaluation are shown in Table
\ref{table:deads}.

\input{tables/deads}

\paragraph{}
All, except one, of the projects in Table \ref{table:deads} are dead because it
was abandoned by the community of contributors. Except for project with ID
587204, which is still receiving updates, but at very slow and sporadic
intervals. However, since the updates do not involve code activity, it is
considered dead.

\paragraph{}
The first 7 projects have died before their first anniversary. The tail 14
projects died between 14 and 142 months of age.

\paragraph{}
When we zoom in on the project with ID 317799, which is the youngest in this set
and died in its second month, we see that this project has had a history of the
slightest change in its lines of code evolution. The project has had a total
number of 7 commits during the time it is being tracked by Ohloh (since
September 2011 up to now). A total of 4 contributors have worked on the project
since it was tracked. The most recent commit was done in October 2011.

\paragraph{}
Project with ID 12547 is the oldest. It died after 142 tracked months, has had
its most recent commits in February 2012. A total of 10 contributors have
worked on this project since May 2000.

\paragraph{}
Our special case project, with ID 587204, is the only project that is not
abandoned by its (entire) community. The project has had 3 contributors over its
lifetime. One of them is still active every now and then. The most recent
commits were done in January 2014, the commits before that were in June 2012.
The commits involved updates in documentation, and the creation of a
configuration file for a continuous integration server.

The project died after 8 months since the first data point tracked, which was in
July 2012.

This chapter presents and clarifies the results obtained during the research.
The focus should be on the factual results, not the interpretation or
discussion. Tables and graphics should be used to increase the clarity of the
results where applicable.
