\chapter{Results}
\label{results}

\begin{comment}
This chapter presents and clarifies the results obtained during the research.
The focus should be on the factual results, not the interpretation or
discussion. Tables and graphics should be used to increase the clarity of the
results where applicable.
Have a look at the the results chapter in this example thesis on Paulâ€™s
homepage\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/ArnoldLankamp.pdf}.
