This thesis is the result of my graduation project and concludes the part-time
Master programme Software Engineering at the University of Amsterdam.

The project has been performed at VNU Vacature Media, the company at which I am
employed at. VNU Vacature Media, since May 2012 a division of De Persgroep
Nederland, operates in the on-line recruitment market. It serves the largest
job boards in The Netherlands and Belgium, such as Intermediair, Nationale
Vacaturebank, Vacature.com, and References.be. The software supporting these
products are mostly open-source, that is why the evolution of open-source
software came to my interest for choosing this subject.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
There are some people I would like to thank that contributed to my project
in various ways. This thesis would not have been possible without them.

\paragraph{}
First, I would like to thank Brett Kelly, who was CTO at VNU Vacature Media at
the time I started the Master's programme, and Rutger Pannekoek, who is CTO of
VNU Vacature Media since 2013. Without them, I wouldn't be able to follow the
Master's programme together with my job in the first place.

(I am sorry if I forget anyone), you were all great in supporting me
conducting my research on the days that I was physically present, but mentally
absent.

I would also like to thank my parents, Johan and Carla Endenburg for letting me
free to make my own choices. They always told me that ``when there's a will,
there's a way''.

Additionally, I would like to thank Siim Karus for helping me replicating his
research. He has been very helpful, especially in the beginning of the project,
in providing me his scripts and insights in his data.

Last, but definitely not least, big thanks to Christine Fr\"{o}ger, for all the
love, support, patience, and encouragements to complete this thesis and for
telling me to take a break every now and then.\\[2em]
