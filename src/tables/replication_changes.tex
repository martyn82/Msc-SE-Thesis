	Sample size & 27 projects & 250 projects & A larger data is believed to yield
	more trustworthy results in terms of the ability to generalise results. \\

	Sample selection & Random and manual complementing & Automatic
	representative selection & Knowing the representativeness and selecting
	projects accordingly increases the ability to generalise the results. \\

	Data gathering & Repository mining & Ohloh analysis & The data gathered by
	the tool \cite{ohlohanalytics, bruntink2013} was gathered from Ohloh
	\cite{ohloh}. Ohloh did the source code repository mining and aggregated and
	analysed this data into monthly facts. Furthermore, the data provided by the
	OhlohAnalytics tool is already validated and cleansed to be consistent. \\

	Data frames & Daily aggregated to weekly & Monthly & No aggregation of the raw
	data was done in the replication, because the data provided from Ohloh and
	OhlohAnalytics is already presented in monthly time frames. \\

	Time series & Days since first commit & Age in months & Similar to the 'Data
	frames' change, the 'days since first commit' is aggregated in 7 day frames in
	the original study. \citeauthor{karus2013} aggregates the other metrics as
	shown in Table \ref{table:karus_series}. In the replication this was not the
	case as the data provided is already in monthly data frames. The aggregation
	was not done because of issues found with aggregation of LOC as discussed in
	section \ref{section:gapless_wavelets}. \\

	Code churn & Sum of LOC added, modified, and removed & Sum of LOC added and
	removed & Ohloh does not track a modified LOC fact. Therefore, the LOC
	modified metric could not be added to the calculation of LOC churn. \\

	Signals & $20\times27=540$ signals (see Table \ref{table:karus_series}) &
	$1\times250=250$ signals (i.e., LOC) & Only LOC is used because of its simple
	interpretation and intuitive representation. \\
