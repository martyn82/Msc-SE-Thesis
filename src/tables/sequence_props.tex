	\textbf{Property} & \textbf{Description} \\
	\hline
	Coefficient type & The type of coefficient; either
	W (wavelet/shift), or V (filter/scale). \\
	Project0 & The identity of the project the sequence was detected in. \\
	Project1 & The identity of the project having the similar sequence. \\
	Level0 & The compression level at which the sequence was detected. \\
	Level1 & The compression level at which the similar sequence was found. \\
	Start0 & The index of the coefficient the detected sequence starts. \\
	Start1 & The index of the coefficient at which the similar sequence starts. \\
	Length & The length representing the number of coefficients of the sequence. \\
	Maximum deviation & A number representing the precision of similarity as the
	maximum deviation between coefficients of project0 and those of project1. \\
	Sequence & The list of coefficients representing the sequence of project0. \\
