\chapter{Motivation}
This section describes in detail what problem the research is addressing, and
what the motivation is to address this problem.
There is a concise and objective statement of the research questions (or
hypotheses you are testing) and goals. It is made clear why these questions and
goals are important and relevant to the outside world (i.e., the field of
research or industry that you are addressing). You can already split the main
research question into sub questions in this chapter.
This section also describes an analysis of the problem: where does it occur and
how, how often, and what are the consequences? An important part is also to
scope to research: what aspects are included and what aspects are deliberately
left out, and why? An example introduction can be found on Paul Klintâ€™s
homepage\footnote{http://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/thesesMasterSoftwareEngineering/2006/ReinierLabee.pdf}.
