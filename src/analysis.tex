\chapter{Analysis and Conclusions}
\label{analysis}

\begin{comment}
This chapter contains the analysis and interpretation of the results. The
research questions are answered as best as possible given the results that were
obtained. The analysis also discussed parts of the questions that were left
unanswered.
An important topic is the validity of the results. What methods of validation
were used? Could the results be generalized to other cases? What threats to
validity can be identified? There is room here to discuss the results of
related scientific literature here as well. How do the results obtained here
relate to other work, and what consequences are there? Did your approach work
better or worse? Did you learn anything new compared to the already existing
body of knowledge? Finally, what could you say in hindsight on the research
approach by followed? What could have done better? What lessons have been
learned? What could other researchers use from your experience? A separate
section should be devoted to ‘future work,’ i.e., possible extension points of
your work that you have identified. Other researchers (or yourself) could use
those as a starting point.
