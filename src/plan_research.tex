\subsection{Question}

\begin{description}
	\item[RQ:] \emph{\researchQuestion}
\end{description}

\subsection{Theory}
The above research question is based on the observation that wavelet analysis is
used in other disciplines to analyse time series (e.g., economics and signal
processing). The idea behind a wavelet transform is that we can sample the same
signal at different intervals giving us a natural means for scaling it. In case
of software evolution, the signal can be any measurable property of an evolving
entity. Software repositories are a source of signals or time series in software
evolution. This allows the wavelet transform to be applied directly for mining
software repositories.

Wavelet analysis is analysis of signals (time series) by decomposing the signal
into wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficients based on wavelet functions
(also known as filters). The decomposition can be repeated on the scaling
coefficients until the number of resulting wavelet coefficients is smaller than
the filter length.

\subsection{Data}
Karus used a data set of 27 OSS projects which together form a representative
distribution of the OSS projects available at ohloh.net at the time of his
study. 18 of these projects were chosen randomly from Google Code Search from
various repositories containing team projects employing different source code
languages, team sizes, and project types. 15 of these projects are on-going and
3 have had no development activity since January 2009 (verified in January
2013). The alive projects have stayed alive for a minimum of 4 years.

In this Master's project, I aim to use a much larger data set that still is a
representative distribution of OSS projects at this time. Using a larger data
set will gather more statistical information to draw more profound conclusions
from.

The data of over 10,000 OSS projects is available at the University of
Amsterdam. Not all of these projects will be of equal use, but certainly a
selection larger than the 27 projects used by Karus will be useful.

\subsection{Method}
During this Master's project, I will replicate the study performed by Karus to
validate (or refute) his conclusions. I will elaborate on finding warning signs
in software evolution as early as possible.

The analysis and data preparation will be conducted in several steps: data
aggregation, discrete wavelet transform, similar region detection, similar
region grouping. The analysis and data aggregation will, just as Karus did, be
performed using R Statistics Suite with ``wavelets'', ``zoo'', and ``chron''
packages. Package ``wavelets'' provides discrete wavelet transform, package
``zoo'' time series methods, and package ``chron'' extends support for date and
time manipulations.
