HOWTO SELECT A SAMPLE DATA SET:
* Go to folder OhlohAnalytics/lib/SampleSoftwareProjects-0.1.1
* There is a masterdata.txt file containing projects from Ohloh.
* Filter this list of projects by keeping only the projects that you have data from and save it as masterdata_filtered (tab-separated)
* Use the R script as located in this folder.
* It writes the results to a new sample.csv file.
* Move the file to the data folder.

THEN:
* Execute the script filter-masterdata.php to filter out projects from ValidatedProjects and keep only the projects from the sample.
* The resulting file from previous step is a text file containing the Ohloh project name linked with the Ohloh project ID.
* Move this SampleProjectNamesListWithIds.csv to the mscsethesis/data folder.
* Then go to the mscsethesis project tools/csv folder.
* Execute the add-project-id.php script to add the Project ID to the monthlyFacts csv and only keep the sample projects.
* Move the resulting file monthlyFactsAfterCleaningWithMetaDataAndId.csv to the data folder.

REPEAT:
* Repeat the above steps to keep a solid sample of monthlyFacts from x projects (where x is your sample size) that have enough data points per project.

FINALLY:
* You end up with a monthlyFacts*.csv file containing x projects and enough data points per project that is representative to the Ohloh universe.
