Wavelet_cum.R: Applies discrete wavelet transform and stores the results in folder “wavelet_cum”
Similar_sequence_analytics.R: Identifies similarities in the transformed data (uses data from folder “wavelet_cum”)
Similar_sequence_popular.R: Counts the occurrences of similar sections identified by the previous script.

The template section and locations of the section in projects are output to file sim.data.csv

Wavelets are applied on commit data as follows:
