Lessons learned from literature study:

Samoladas:
- Project duration
- Application domain
- Number of committers/active developers
- Conclusion: Yes, these characteristics can be used to analyze survivability. Adding a developer increases chances of survival.

Raja:
- Project viability dimensions:
  - vigor (growth)
  - resilience
  - organization.
- Conclusion: yes, these dimensions exist in the context of viability (levensvatbaarheid).

Crowston (Defining OSS success):
- DeLone & McLean model of success:
  - output (high release frequency)
  - process (no. of developers/committers, developer activity, cycle time (release frequeny))
  - project effects (knowledge creation, individual reputation, opportunities to developers)
- The model comprises aspects that are indicators of project success.

Crowston (Success in FLOSS development):
- Count of developers is flawed, it aggregates the number of developers left and joined. Better: a developers churn or tenure (ambtsperiode, tijd van activiteit)

Wang:
- Six crucial factors of OSS success:
  - developer participation effort
  - developer service quality
  - software license restrictiveness
  - targeted users
  - community social network ties
  - community quality of social ties
